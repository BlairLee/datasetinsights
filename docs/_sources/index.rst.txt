Welcome to the Unity Dataset Insights documentation!
================================
Thea is a repo for synthetic dataset insights maintained by Unity Technologies.
This repo enables users to analyze the synthetic datasets that they have generated using the `Perception SDK <https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.perception>`_
or the for the `Unity game engine <https://unity.com/>`_ and, optionally, at scale using
`Unity Simulations <https://unity.com/products/simulation>`_, by exposing the metrics collected when the dataset
was created e.g. object count, label distribution, etc. To use our sample notebooks pull our docker image
unitytechnologies/datasetinsights
