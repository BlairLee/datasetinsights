Welcome to the Unity Dataset Insights documentation!
================================
Unity Dataset Insights is a python package for understanding synthetic datasets.
This package enables users to analyze synthetic datasets generated using the `Perception SDK <https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.perception>`_
for the for the `Unity game engine <https://unity.com/>`_ and, optionally, at scale using
`Unity Simulations <https://unity.com/products/simulation>`_. Dataset Insights exposes the metrics collected when the dataset
was created e.g. object count, label distribution, etc. To use our sample notebooks pull our docker image
